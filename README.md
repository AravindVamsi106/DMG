**Introduction:**
The Dynamic QR Based Menu Generator (DMG) is a web application tailored to modernize menu management for restaurants and cafes in today's digital era. It offers an intuitive platform for admins to seamlessly update menus based on item availability in the kitchen. Customers can conveniently access the updated menu by scanning the QR code placed on their table, ensuring they only view currently available items.

**Key Features:**
1. **Real-time Menu Updates:** Admins can swiftly update the menu based on item availability, ensuring customers are presented with the most current options.

3. **Ordering Functionality:** Customers can place orders directly through the application, streamlining the ordering process. Orders are promptly sent to the restaurant's admin along with a unique order ID for easy tracking.
4. **Post-meal Feedback:** Upon completion of their meal, customers are presented with a rating form, allowing them to provide feedback on the items ordered. These ratings are dynamically integrated into the pie charts, providing valuable insights for future customers.

**Benefits:**
1. **Customization:** DMG offers easy customization, enabling restaurants to tailor their menus efficiently.
2. **Cost-efficiency:** By eliminating the need for printed menus, DMG reduces printing costs and promotes environmental sustainability.
